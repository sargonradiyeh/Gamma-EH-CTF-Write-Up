# Gamma Ethical Hacking CTF Write-up

## üìÅ Project Overview

This repository contains a detailed write-up of a multi-stage ethical hacking Capture the Flag (CTF) simulation targeting a hybrid enterprise network. The report demonstrates realistic attack chains across Windows Active Directory infrastructure and Linux servers. The objective was to gain initial access, escalate privileges, perform credential harvesting, and evaluate the environment‚Äôs security posture through practical, real-world techniques.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Target Environment

The simulated environment included:

- **Windows Active Directory Domain Controller**  
- **Two Domain-Joined Windows Hosts (Box A & Box B)**  
- **A Standalone Linux Server Running Joomla CMS**  

These machines formed a realistic enterprise network with domain-linked users, misconfigurations, vulnerable services, and exploitable attack paths.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

The engagement followed a structured red-team/penetration testing approach across multiple platforms:

- **Reconnaissance & Enumeration**  
  - Network and host discovery using tools like `nmap`, `arp-scan`, and `netdiscover`  
  - User, group, and share enumeration via `CrackMapExec`, `rpcclient`, and `smbclient`  
  - Active Directory mapping using `BloodHound` and `bloodhound-python`  
  - Web enumeration and analysis with `Dirsearch`, `JoomScan`, `Burp Suite`, and `CeWL`

- **Initial Access & Exploitation**  
  - Gaining access through weak credentials, misconfigured services, or vulnerable web apps  
  - Joomla admin panel compromise via brute-force with custom wordlists  
  - Remote shell access using tools like `impacket-psexec`, `wmiexec`, and custom PHP reverse shells

- **Privilege Escalation**  
  - On Windows: exploiting service misconfigurations (e.g., unquoted paths, writable registries), DLL hijacking, scheduled tasks, and AlwaysInstallElevated  
  - On Linux: leveraging `sudo` misconfigurations, weak PATH controls, insecure cron jobs, and exposed scripts or credentials

- **Credential Attacks**  
  - Dumping credentials with `Mimikatz`, `hashdump`, and `secretsdump.py`  
  - Performing offline cracking with `Hashcat` and `John the Ripper`  
  - Extracting GPP-stored passwords and performing AS-REP Roasting & Kerberoasting via `Impacket`

- **Post-Exploitation**  
  - Establishing NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM shells  
  - Lateral movement across domain-joined systems  
  - Domain controller compromise and golden ticket generation  
  - Full flag collection and documentation of persistence techniques
